intro: |
  I majored in Statistics during my undergraduate study and am interested in statistics theories. Thus, I came here for Maser's Degree in Statistics last year and graduated in May. My research interests are the application of statistical methods in biological datasets.
  
  
  I am interested in Causal Inference because it is a very important topic in biomedical data analysis and it could be combined with many methodologies. Its semiparametric analysis is also very interesting to me. I think it is much useful for my future research in biomedical data.
