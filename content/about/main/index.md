intro: |
  I majored in Statistics during my undergraduate study and am interested in statistics theories. Thus, I came here for Maser's Degree in Statistics last year and graduated in May. My research interests are the application of statistical methods in biological datasets.
  
  
  I am interested in Causal Inference because it is a very important topic in biomedical data analysis and it could be combined with many methodologies. Its semiparametric analysis is also very interesting to me. I think it is much useful for my future research in biomedical data.

  **Abstract**: Dimensionality reduction of spatial omic data can reveal shared, spatially structured patterns of expression across a collection of genomic features. We studied strategies for discovering and interactively visualizing low-dimensional structure in spatial omic data based on the construction of neighborhood features. We designed quantile and network-based spatial features that result in spatially consistent embeddings. A simulation compares embeddings made with and without neighborhood-based featurization, and a re-analysis of Keren et al., 2019 illustrates the overall workflow. We provide an R package, NBFvis, to support computation and interactive visualization for the proposed dimensionality reduction approach. Code and data for reproducing experiments and analysis are available on GitHub.
