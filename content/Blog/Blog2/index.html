<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The authors developed a new method for g-formula called parametric g-formula, and they applied it to a worked example about the mortality among the bone marrow transplant patients.</p>
</div>
<div id="background-setting" class="section level1">
<h1>Background setting</h1>
<p>The author would like to know how much they could reduce mortality among bone marrow transplant patients by prescribing a new drug that prevents <strong>graft-versus-host disease(GvHD)</strong>, a side effect of allogeneic marrow transplantation. Whether the patient gets the GvHD(i.e., whether the patient takes the prevention drug) is the treatment variable in this experiment.</p>
<p>Although GvHD is associated in observational studies with an increased risk of mortality, it also reduces the risk of <strong>leukemia relapse</strong>. It means that any drug that prevents GvHD may have the very undesirable side effect of increasing the rate of relapse.</p>
<p>Note that leukemia relapse is a risk factor for mortality and subsequent GvHD and it will also decrease the incidence of subsequent relapse, which means that leukemia relapse is a <strong>time-varying confounder</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="goal" class="section level1">
<h1>Goal</h1>
<p>The author would like to compare the mortality with and without the GvHD prevention drug with the time-varying confounder taken into consideration.</p>

<div id="assumptions" class="section level1">
<h1>Assumptions:</h1>
<p>The assumptions in this paper are the three basic assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positivity; (<span class="math inline">\(P(A=a)\in (0,1)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.)</li>
<li>SUTVA;</li>
<li>Conditional exchangeability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two assumptions are very common in casual inference paper and it is a common practice that we assume they are satisfied.</p>
<p>As to the last assumption, the author argue that they assume that they strive to measure and control for strong confounders of the exposure-outcome relationship to avoid making inference based on spurious relationships, which could be considered as they satisfying the conditional exchangeability.</p>
<p>In addition, we usually do use sequential exchangeability instead of conditional exchangeability in such time-varying model. The reason why they use the conditional exchangeability here is that the covariate is fixed according to the time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> so that we can build a complete probability model using g-formula.</p>
</div>
<div id="identification" class="section level1">
<h1>Identification</h1>
<p>Here we use the g-formula to compute the marginal incidence of death by the end of follow up at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> under intervening <span class="math inline">\(A_k\)</span>. For simplicity, we assume that all the data are observed so the <span class="math inline">\(cencor_k\)</span> is ignored in this g-formula compared with the one in the paper.</p>

<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(Pr(V=v_0|A_{k-1}=a_{k-1},L_k=l_k,Y_{k-1}=0)\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is irrelative to other variables. Thus, we can further simplify the equation as follows.</p>

&amp;Pr(Y_{m-1}=0|A_{m-1}=a_{m-1},L_{m-1}=l_{m-1},V=v_o,Y_{m-2}=0)] \\

<p>The author constructed three parameter regression models by samples to predict the following probabilities:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Pr(L_k=l_k|A_{k-1}=a_{k-1]},L_k=l_k,V=v_o,Y_{k-1}=0)\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Pr(A_k=a_k|A_{k-1}=a_{k-1]},L_k=l_k,V=v_o,Y_{k-1}=0)\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Pr(Y_k=1|A_{k}=a_{k]},L_k=l_k,V=v_o,Y_{k-1}=0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Hence, we can compute <span class="math inline">\(E(Y_t)\)</span> by the equation above.</p>
<p>If we want to intervene certain variables like <span class="math inline">\(A_k\)</span>, we can use the same g-formula with <span class="math inline">\(A_k=a\)</span>. This computes the effect of GvHD on mortality rates.</p>
</div>
<div id="interpretation" class="section level1">
<h1>Interpretation</h1>
<p>From the g-formula we get, we can see that the mortality rate is the summation and product of the probabilities of many variables given that at the previous time by g-formula.</p>
<p>One observation is that this paper treats the platelet level as an indicator of the leukemia relapse. I think it could be a proxy variable for the leukemia relapse. If so, the model would be more complicated than before.</p>
