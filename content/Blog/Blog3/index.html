<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The authors developed a new method for g-formula called parametric g-formula, and they applied it to a worked example about the mortality among the bone marrow transplant patients.</p>
</div>
<div id="background-setting" class="section level1">
<h1>Background setting</h1>
<p>The author would like to know how much they could reduce mortality among bone marrow transplant patients by prescribing a new drug that prevents <strong>graft-versus-host disease(GvHD)</strong>, a side effect of allogeneic marrow transplantation. Whether the patient gets the GvHD(i.e., whether the patient takes the prevention drug) is the treatment variable in this experiment.</p>
<p>Although GvHD is associated in observational studies with an increased risk of mortality, it also reduces the risk of <strong>leukemia relapse</strong>. It means that any drug that prevents GvHD may have the very undesirable side effect of increasing the rate of relapse.</p>
<p>Note that leukemia relapse is a risk factor for mortality and subsequent GvHD and it will also decrease the incidence of subsequent relapse, which means that leukemia relapse is a <strong>time-varying confounder</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="goal" class="section level1">
<h1>Goal</h1>
<p>The author would like to compare the mortality with and without the GvHD prevention drug with the time-varying confounder taken into consideration.</p>
